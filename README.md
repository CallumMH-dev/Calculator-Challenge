# Calculator Challenge!

"Simple" challenge, just for fun!

The rules and requirements:

- Create a Calculator ( Terminal or Gui (personal pref.) )
- Everytime you create the calculator you MUST do something different in the next iteration.
- You will hit a wall, this is to be expected.
- Once you have really really tried to get over this wall and still can't think of any alternative, proceed to next step.
- Begin compiling your code with older compiler version, i.e. instead of c++2x go to c++1x all the way to pre C++98.
- Refactor your hardstuck iteration so that it is C++98 compatible!

Whats the point in all this?

Well, firstly it's to get you to think in new creative ways for your solutions, secondly, debugging,
debugging is such an important part of programming and trying to make your weird solution compatible with older
C++ versions will really test you, it will make you dwell on the niceties of modern C++.

This isn't meant to be taken too seriously, this is just for fun, if you aren't having fun, just stop.
