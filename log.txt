This is to be used as a development log, so you can keep track and just brainstorm ideas:

so the first iteration is just a standard way I'd say to do a calculator,
5 functions (add, divi, userInput etc.) and a switch case.

iteration two notes:
created a calc function, instead of the switch i have 4 ifs,
thought about templating but I just dislike how this looks in a whole.
went for an xmacro for this.

also got rid of iostream.
